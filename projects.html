  <h3> Genetic basis of colour polymorphisms in tiger moths </h3>
    <p> Stunning colour diversity can be seen on the wings of tiger moths. This colouration can be adapted for a range of functions including camouflage, warning, sexual signals and thermoregulation. In my current project, I am studying the genetic variation that led to the evolution of these colour patterns. By identifying structural variants and regulatory elements in the genome that influence gene expression, we aim to pinpoint novel genetic elements such as microRNAs that create this variation in appearance, and determine if they are repeated across related species. I will also examine how different colour morphs are maintained within populations when we expect natural selection to lead to a single aposematic colour pattern. By understanding these genetic mechanisms, we can gain insights into the evolutionary processes that shape the remarkable diversity of these moths, and more generally, how new traits evolve.  </p>
<h3> Evolution of structural colour in <i>Heliconius</i> butterflies</h3>
<p> My PhD focused on iridescent structural colour in the Heliconius butterflies. Using phenotypic and genomic data, I looked at the genetic basis of this trait in two distantly related species. We found limited genetic parallels between the two species. I also looked at the condition dependence of this trait and how stress during development affects colour and scale structure.
